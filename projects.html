                <p>"Shuffle Master" is a game developed with Rollic that underwent a soft launch and was tested
                    through 4 iterations. During the development of this game, I also monitored the status of other
                    projects within the company.</p>

                <p>This game was made for Rollic and had a soft launch, achieving 50 million downloads. During its
                    development, I was also working on the development of "Shuffle Master" and "Theme Park Rush." I was
                    responsible for overseeing the development process of this game and assisting with any issues that
                    arose.</p>

                <p>The research and development of the game were done by me. During the research phase, animation
                    systems, basketball rules, and main menu mechanics were studied, and their algorithms and animation
                    systems were created.

                    In the development phase, the game was polished.

                    I left the project during the addition of the training section, one of the later iterations of the
                    game, due to my military service.

                    This game was published by Virtual Projects.</p>

                <p>"Theme Park Rush" is an idle game developed with Rollic. It underwent a soft launch. The game was
                    created by a team of three developers and was completed in about three weeks. I was responsible for
                    the main mechanics of the game and managing the other two developers. Additionally, our team created
                    the company's idle game template, which helped shorten the development process for other games.</p>

                <p>I joined the game for the third iteration. My task was to allow the player to make free moves on the
                    tactics board and ensure it worked in the 3D gameplay.

                    The game was made for Rollic and underwent a soft lunch.</p>

                <p>Due to the potential need for AI in large games in the future, I learned this technology and
